# Go To Bosnia

The people who go to Bosnia and conduct the camps all over the country are the **Travel Team**. They work with, live
with, eat and drink with, walk, ride, swim, play, pray, sing and dance with the beautiful people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Lucky them! It is challenging, wonderful, life-changing work. We invite you to consider serving on the Travel Team and
think of others who might serve well on the team.

In the months before the trip, the Travel Team meets monthly to plan and prepare for traveling to Bosnia and running the
Friendship Camps, as well as get to know each other before the trip in June.

### Who Can Serve

Travel Team members are ages 16 to 86. Some 15-year-olds are eligible if accompanied by an adult relative. Team members
must be physically and emotionally healthy, work well on a team, and have a passion for helping children.

### Transportation and Housing

The Travel Team flies together from New Jersey to Sarajevo, Bosnia, and back. We coordinate the travel for out-of-state
Travel Team members as well. In-country we travel from town to town in a chartered coach bus.

In some towns we stay in hotels (usually 1-3 per room); in two towns we stay in host homes (usually 2-3 per family); and
in two other towns we stay with partner organizations in their guest housing facilities.

## I want to travel!

We're so excited that you are interested in going to Bosnia with the team. We aren't taking applications right now,
but feel free to [send us a message]
