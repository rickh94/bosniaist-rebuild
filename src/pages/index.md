### The Pandemic has prevented us from traveling

The Leadership Team is busy discussing and planning for our next trip. However, it's not possible to predict when it
will be.

## Our Ministry

The **Bosnia International Servant Trip** is a ministry of the
[New Jersey Synod](https://njsynod.org), [ELCA](https://elca.org) that strives to build peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina
through the wonderful children of this beautiful country. Each year, together with our Bonsian partners and friends, we
conduct one-day camps across the country to promote peace, reconciliation, and racial and ethnic equality. See how you
can get involved below!
