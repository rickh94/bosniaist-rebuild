## Support Us from Home

The trip would not be possible with the support and assistance of our communities here in the U.S. working to ensure we
are supplied and prepared for the trip.

### Projects

#### Tote Bag Decorating

Each year the Home Team hand-decorates a canvas tote bag for every child and teacher that attends one of our Friendship
Camps or Camp New Hope. We need up to 1,200 each year. If you would like to decorate some tote bags,
please [contact us](/contact-us) and [download the instructions](/assets/uploads/tote-bag-instructions.pdf).

#### Sewing Project

Each year we make hand-made sewn gifts as soft, tangible reminders to show the children they are beloved. We need to
make up to 1,200 of these items. Please [contact us](/contact-us) if you want to sew or have any questions.

### Prayer

We appreciate support in the form of prayer. Please pray for:

- Peace and reconciliation for the people and communities of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Balkans, and the whole world
- Members of the Travel Team and fellow members of the Home Team
- Our coordinators and interpreters in Bosnia-Herzegovina
- The Children and Teachers who will attend our camps this summer

### Financial Support

#### General Support

You can give to the Bosnia IST [online](http://www.njsynod.org/bosniadonation)
or [by mail](/assets/uploads/donationform.pdf). We greatly appreciate donations of any
size to support our ministry.

#### Sponsor a Camp

Each summer we will host Friendship Camps throughout Bosnia. These camps are for children ages 10-13 (and anyone else
who shows up!), and will work to bring Healing, Hope & Peace into their lives and their communities. Each camp has
anywhere from 60-350+ students, with 10-20 teachers present. Each Camp needs financial sponsorship of $2,600. Half
sponsorships are also available

### Sports Equipment Donations

Each year we take sports equipment for the schools and youth programs who participate in our camps to use year round.
A full set for each camp consists of:

- 3 basketballs
- 3 volleyballs
- 3 soccer balls
- 3 jump ropes
- 3 beach balls
- 2 basketball nets
- 3 ball pumps and needles

Even if you can only donate a few items, that’d be great, we’ll take it!This is a great project for a Sunday School,
Youth Group or Scout troop. If you’re interested in donating some or all of these
items, [get more details](/assets/uploads/bosnia-sports-equipment.pdf) and [contact us](/contact-us).
