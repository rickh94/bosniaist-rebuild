**Lori Lepelletier** *Redeemer, Succasunna* worked in Mexico on an ELCA Servant-Hunger-Poverty Trip before starting
seminary.

**Larissa Kravanja** *Nativity, East Brunswick* traveled to South America and Africa with a UN Womenâ€™s Organization.

**Dan Nelson** *Calvary, Cranford* spent a summer in Africa on a humanitarian aid mission.

**Susie Wilson** *Redeemer, Ramsey* has lead International Servant Trips to Mexico and other servant trips within the
United States.
