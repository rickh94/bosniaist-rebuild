## Our ministry...

### ...brings healing

Mark Schulz (Zion, Long Valley) tells of a camp where he saw a young boy sitting alone at lunch. He went over and tried
to talk with him -- at one point even bringing over an interpreter. By the end of lunch, he had yet to elicit a single
smile or word. However, at the end of camp as Mark was saying goodbye to some other boys, he felt someone hugging his
leg. He looked down and, sure enough, it was that little boy from lunch, who looked up at him and started counting…one,
two, three, four…until Mark, laughing, stopped him. One of the school teachers who had been observing this, walked over
to Mark and told him that that was the first time anyone at the school had ever heard this boy talk.

### ...offers hope

A young girl looked sad as our Friendship Camp in Bihac ended. Bobby Houser, one of our partners in this ministry,
walked over to her and asked her what was wrong. “No one cares about me. There is no reason for me to be alive," she
responded. Bobby got out her calendar and flipped it to the following summer and pointed to a date. “This is the day we
will be back here next June. I love you. I want to see you here next year.” The following summer our bus pulled up to
the school, and who was sitting on the steps, waiting for us? That young girl.

### ...builds peace

Jason Reed (St. Paul, Hainesport) was in the Serb village of Sipovo waiting in a bank to exchange some of the team
money, when a Chetnik (a radical, nationalist Serb) called out to him in Serbian, "Why do Americans hate Serbs?" – but
he asked it in a very personal way – “Why do you hate me?” Jason responded that he didn’t hate him and that all
Americans didn’t hate Serbs. "But you bomb our towns and kill our people," the Chetnik responded. They talked for five
minutes until the money was ready. As Jason left, Vesna, his interpreter (a Baptist Serb from Croatia, if you can
believe it) turned to him and said, "Do you know what they are talking about back there (in the bank)? They are
questioning everything they thought they knew about Americans; everything they have been told about Americans." The next
year we returned to this town, Jason was interviewed on their radio station and had the opportunity to share why we came
back to Sipovo.
