## Church Connections

### Congregational Involvement

Each year members of our congregations spend thousands of hours serving the children of Bosnia through the Home Team
projects. They have made thousands of emoji keychains, teddy bears, lions, giraffes, monkeys, hug pillows, and more.
Their involvement can deepen their understanding of Christian servanthood in the world and increase their awareness of
the need for peace and prayer in the world. It can also serve as a springboard for new ministry endeavors.

### Interreligious

In Bosnia we serve in a very religiously diverse country. While the children we work with are from all the different
ethnic and religious backgrounds, our interpreters are primarily (though not exclusively) Muslim. Over the years our
relationships with them have developed into ones of deep respect and love. We have brought some of these young leaders
to the United States to help lead programs at ELCA National Youth Gatherings. The inter-religious nature of our
ministry, particularly in relation to our Bosnian Muslim coordinator and interpreters, is an emphasis of the ELCA, and
one we are exploring new ways to strengthen.

### The wider church

This trip is well-known in the ELCA, having been featured in the Lutheran Magazine, in Mosaics, and three ELCA National
Youth Gatherings. Consequently, we have become a model for international servant ministry and have provided advice and
training for many other groups and synods. Our ministry also continues to call attention to the need to provide ongoing
relief in countries suffering from the after-effects of war, especially to the children.
