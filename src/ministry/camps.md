## Camps

Each year we have the best job on the planet: We get to dance, sing, play, eat, and practice peace with the beautiful
children of Bosnia-Herzegovina!

### Friendship Camps

Friendship Camps are daylong programs held in schools and occasionally other settings (orphanages, special-needs
programs, etc.) that focus on teamwork, the strength found in a diverse group of people working together, and on the fun
of tackling a shared challenge. We use music and drama exercises, conflict resolution, and diversity training. We spend
the day with the children playing together, singing together, sharing stories, creating art, and eating and laughing
together. We give the children, the teachers in attendance that day, and the schools gifts â€” including the gift of our
time and love.

Friendship Camps camps are for children ages 10-13 (and anyone else who shows up!) and are intended to help bring
Healing, Hope & Peace into their lives and their communities. Between 60 and 300 students and 10-20 teachers typically
attend each camp.

### Camp New Hope

In the summer of 2013 we started a new program: Camp New Hope. It was a three-day retreat with a select group of young
leaders invited from school in northern Bosnia from different ethnic communities. We brought these young people and one
teacher from each school together to explore issues of identity and relationships built on hope and a shared desire for
peace. This program was designed and led with key partners in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It was VERY exciting! We have
conducted the Camp New Hope program each year since.
